# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I’m an engineer working at the intersection of **reinforcement learning, robotics-oriented simulation, and agentic AI systems** — with a long-term focus on embodied intelligence and real-world control.

This GitHub reflects a structured transition:
from classical software and control engineering → modern AI agents → reinforcement learning → physics-based robotics simulation.

## 🧭 Current Focus

My current work centers on building a **coherent learning and experimentation stack** for reinforcement learning and robotics:

- **Reinforcement Learning Foundations → Locomotion → Robotics Simulation**
- PPO-based continuous control in physics environments
- Analysis-first RL workflows (training, rollouts, diagnostics)
- Agentic AI systems (MCP, tool-using agents) as a parallel track

Rather than isolated demos, the emphasis is on **conceptual progression** and **engineering intuition**.

## 🧠 Featured Work

### 🔹 RL → Robotics Learning Stack
A staged learning path documenting the transition from tabular RL to continuous locomotion and physics-based control.

- **Stage 1 — RL Foundations**: tabular methods and control intuition  
- **Stage 2 — Neural Policy RL**: DQN, policy gradients, actor–critic, PPO  
- **Stage 3 — Continuous Control & Locomotion**: PPO in physics environments (Pendulum → BipedalWalker → MuJoCo)

📌 See the `rl-to-robotics-learning-stack` repo and linked stage repos.

### 🔹 Agentic AI & MCP Systems
Design and implementation of **tool-using, multi-agent AI systems**, including:

- Supervisor/worker agent patterns  
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and tools  
- Emphasis on clarity, inspectability, and system-level behavior  

This work runs in parallel with RL as part of a broader interest in **learning systems that act, not just predict**.

---

## 🛠 Background

I bring **30+ years of experience** across:

- software engineering  
- electronic hardware and instrumentation  
- control systems and automation  

That background strongly shapes how I approach AI:
as a **control problem**, grounded in dynamics, feedback, and behavior over time — not just model outputs.

Today, my focus is on bridging that engineering perspective with modern learning-based systems.

## 🧩 Perspective

Two ideas strongly influence how I think about AI and robotics:

> “The biggest breakthroughs in AI have come from methods that scale with computation.”  
> — Rich Sutton, *The Bitter Lesson*

and

> *Moravec’s Paradox*:  
> High-level reasoning is often easier for machines than low-level perception and control.

Together, they point toward embodied learning:
systems that acquire intelligence through **interaction, physics, and experience**, not handcrafted rules.

## 🚀 What’s Next

The next stage of this work moves into:

- GPU-accelerated robotics simulation
- Isaac Gym / Isaac Lab–style environments
- More explicit reward design, diagnostics, and policy evaluation
- Deeper focus on robustness, efficiency, and stability

The goal is not just to train agents — but to **understand what they learn and why**.
